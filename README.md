# Notes App

A simple, full-stack **Notes Management App** built with **React**, allowing users to create, edit, delete, and toggle favorite notes. Users can register, log in, and manage their notes securely. The app interacts with an external API to persist the data, and features a pleasant UI to manage your notes efficiently.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and log out to manage their personal notes.
- **Note Management**: Users can create, edit, delete, and toggle the importance of their notes.
- **Favorites Toggle**: Filter and view favorite (important) notes separately from all notes.
- **Responsive UI**: User-friendly UI to navigate between the applicationâ€™s features, including a responsive form for creating new notes.
- **Dynamic Note Editing**: Users can edit any note in place or cancel edits.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework for building the UI components.
- **React Router**: For handling the routing between the pages.
- **Local Storage**: For storing the user session information securely in the browser.
- **Axios**: For interacting with the external API to manage notes.
- **CSS**: Custom styles for UI components.
